# slide-wl

A Wayland compositor port of [slide](https://github.com/kantiankant/slide) from Xserver to Wayland, built on the wlroots library (built against wlroots 0.20).

> **Work in progress:** This is highly experimental, so expect things to break before it becomes usable

## Concept

Go read the README.md at [slide](https://github.com/kantiankant/slide), then come back

## Dependencies

Build-time:
- `wlroots-0.20`
- `scenefx-0.4` (probably, I forgot)
- `wayland-server`
- `xkbcommon`
- `libinput`
- `wayland-scanner` (for the layer shell protocol header)
- `bmake` (most likely to work because the Makefile has BSD-isms. `gmake` may work, but no promises)

Optional (used in the default config, but for the love of Christ, please edit it to your needs beforehand):
- `foot`  (terminal)
- `wofi`  (app launcher)
- `grim` + `slurp`  (screenshots)
- `swayosd` (OSD daemon)
  
## Building

On Linux:

```sh
bmake
sudo/doas bmake install   # installs to /usr/local/bin by default
```

On FreeBSD:  

```sh
make
sudo/doas make install   # installs to /usr/local/bin by default
```
To set a custom prefix:

```sh
make PREFIX=~/.local install
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.h` before building. The defaults assume `foot`, `rofi`, `yazi`, `kew`, `ani-cli`, and `kantbar`. Swap them out for whatever you actually use.

Key tunables in `config.h`:

| Constant | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WIN_MOVE_STEP` | 60 | Pixels per keyboard window-move |
| `PAN_STEP` | 120 | Pixels per keyboard viewport pan |

## Keybinds (defaults)

### Launching things

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super+Q` | Open terminal (foot) |
| `Super+E` | File manager (yazi) |
| `Super+R` | Music player (kew) |
| `Super+Shift+R` | ani-cli |
| `Super+Space` | App launcher (rofi drun) |
| `Print` | Screenshot (grim + slurp) |

### Window management

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super+W` | Kill focused window |
| `Super+C` | Center focused window |
| `Super+F` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `Super+Shift+H/J/K/L` | Move window left/down/up/right (doesn't work yet) |
| `Super+Ctrl+H/L` | Cycle focus backward/forward |

### Viewport / canvas

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super+H/J/K/L` | Pan viewport left/down/up/right |

### Mouse

| Gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| Click | Focus window |
| `Super+LMB drag` | Move window |
| `Super+RMB drag` | Resize window |
| `Super+Shift+RMB drag` | Pan viewport |

### System

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super+Shift+E` | Quit compositor (doesn't work on the *BSDs for some wretched reason) |
| Volume keys | Adjust audio via wpctl |
| Brightness keys | Adjust backlight |

## Running

```sh
slide-wl [-s startup_command] (but for the love of Christ, please use dbus to launch it)
```

The `-s` flag runs a command at startup (useful for launching a bar or autostart script).

`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, and `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` are set automatically.

## Tested on

- FreeBSD (probably doesn't work anymore because the code now has Linux-isms; use at your own risk
- Arch
- Alpine Linux Edge
- Void Musl
- Void Glibc


## Checklist

- [x] zoom support
